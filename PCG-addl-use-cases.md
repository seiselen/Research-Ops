# Target Use-Cases For Procedural Content Generation

## Purpose and Introduction

_**Note:** This document was originally created in the Fall 2019 Semester as part of preliminary work towards one of the candidate topics for a Graduate Thesis Project that mever happened; and is contained here for archival and future-use purposes._

Clay suggested that I find several applications from which to orient my research thesis/work WRT Procedural Content Generation (hereafter **PCG**). IIRC - he further suggested that, if possible: I find applications that are either disjoint from interactive entertainment (i.e. 'video games'), and/or pedagogical in nature and function. Further: I know from the scope of this topic that I should also find more specific/targeted applications; as 'pursuing the frontier and limits of what PCG can do' i.e. 'The Naughtiest Problem' is, standalone, WAY too big in scope and scale for a career, let alone a MS thesis.

This document enumerates and briefly discusses three such applications in addition to games/simulations: as to compose four in total. I begin with describing the 'common ground' each share (WRT purpose, requirements, authors, audience, and challenges, etc.) such that the procedural generation solutions I wish to focus my research on could solve problems and service demands among two or more of the four; then discuss each individually. The four applications are as follows:

1. **Serious Games / Simulations**
2. **Interactive Digital Storytelling**
3. **Architectural Design / CAD**
4. **Interactive Entertainment**.
