<!-- Scheduler Activity Sample Struct:     
     
     Notes:
      - This acts as both a 'script' and identifies stuff involved with each task
      - Assumes that failure to do a task (i.e. no closest food) simply skips over the task/event
      - Assumes that no activity (i.e. idle) results in NPC doing some idle behavior a-la Oblivion
      - Assumes given timeframes 'work', else we need some 'in-case-character-late' handling?
