# (Key Concept) PCG Method Groups and Workflows

## Overview and Introduction

It's important to distinguish between PCG methods which utilize Machine Learning (hereafter ML) versus those that do not, for the same reason why it's likewise important to partition Behavioral (i.e. 'Classic') AI from Machine Learning. This is especially directly the case in that there exists both a family of agent-oriented PCG methods (i.e. Behavioral AI), and another family of ML-oriented methods; though is generally the case WRT differences in algorithms, data structures, knowledge representation, and other features between such groups of similar methods. Of course: all of these seek to accomplish the game goal of PCG, and indeed many of the larger scale and 'more ambitious' ML methods / techniques / systems utilize a composite of various levels containing various individual generators from multiple such groups. While the textbook 'Procedural Content Generation in Games' provides a good contrast from some of the top experts in PCG, I will offer my own 'Quick-And-Dirty' definitions as follows; followed by the concept of 'Generator-Empowered Workflows' which can (and does) bridge these types together.
