## Notes Thereof

### L-01
* **Progress:** Full Skim
* Detailed description of Voronoi-Based Procy-Gen worlds in 2D and 3D
* I actually did visit this sometime in 2021 when implementing BROADGATE project 'Fun With Voronoi (Diagrams)'

### L-02
* **Progress:** (Likely Half-Assed) Full Skim
* Some discussion on implementation of 'Interactive Procedural Street Modeling' model
* Covers lot generation (natural consequent of roads - duh?), galaxy generation, and more

### L-03
* **Progress:** Downloaded and started reading one of the texts (which one?)
* Goes into everything from the 2D simple L-system plants to effectively SpeedTree
