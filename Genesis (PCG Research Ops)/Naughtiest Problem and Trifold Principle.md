# The Naughtiest Problem and Trifold Principle of PCG

## The Naughtiest Problem

### Introduction and History

**'The Naughtiest Problem'** is a toy problem I developed which encompassed the realization of extremely advanced and detailed 3D simulation worlds that are mostly if not fully procedurally generated by computers *(i.e. s.t. human involvement is at most minor and high-level)*. More specifically: it invites discussion regarding:
* The features, requirements, and constraints of such worlds and the creation thereof; 
* The definition of how much human-provded context, content, and otherwise design/direction is needed for their creation (as well as the theoretical mimimum/optimum levels thereof); and
* How worlds that derive from and/or relate with a pre-written lore can be correctly initialized thereto WRT some specified point-in-time, consistently follow *(if not mirror)* its remaining progression *(and by what min error)*, and most interestingly: 'naturally' extend and expand itself past all pre-existing (human authored) lore

I have been thinking about this problem for many years, and it was one of the primary reasons why I returned to college to study Computer Science. However, I'm not necessarily alone in this pursuit, nor are the other people who have an interest in Procedural Content Generation (hereafter **PCG**). Almost everyone of even the slightest creative mind has likely many times envisioned stepping into a fictional world, interacting with it *(including directing its progression - both implicitly and explicitly)*, exploring an infinite numnber of alternate progressions/histories thereof, merging it with other universes *(including our own)*, and/or expanding it beyond the events described bt its authors/creators. Indeed there are entire genres of this popular throughout the internet; including *'Alternate Histories'*, *'Fan Fiction'*, and even highly collaborative and interconnected universes such as that of *'The SCP Foundation'*, *'The Backrooms'*, *'Creepypastas'*, and more.

However, it was around 2017 when I started explore beyond the 'surface level' and commence a more serious contemplation to this problem and how to build a model thereto *(which was also when it received its official and silly-yet-fitting name)*. To the latter, and as introduction to the problem itself: I was taking a graduate course in Computer Graphics at the time, for which the instructor was retired USAF Lt.Col. Dr. Elton P Amburn. Having previously discussed both my interests in PCG and our mutual interests/experience with immersive Virtual Reality: I visited one of his office hours where, following a short greeting, I informed him of ***"had a very naughty problem of mine that I needed to discuss"***. Lt.Col. Amburn, of course, reacted understandably with apprehension and concern for whatevee I was about to discuss; and this was, of course, the appropriate reaction for what I would go on to discuss...

### The Naughtiest Problem

*In Algorithmics, problem definitions are often prefaced with the phrase "Suggest an algorithm that…". I retain this preface for the sake of tradition. With that said, the original description of this problem is as follows…*

> *Suggest an algorithm that takes as its 'content-input' the books, artwork, films, 3D models, and all other lore and multimedia encompassing the Tolkien Legendarium (i.e. universe described and documented by JRR Tolkien via The Silmarillion, Hobbit, Lord of the Rings, etc.) and outputs (i.e. procedurally generates) a highly detailed, realistic, and immersive interactive 3D simulation of Arda (i.e. Middle Earth) such that the world is 'Physically Stable' and 'Contextually Consistent.*
>
> *The output will include all of the terrain, settlements, locations, landmarks, flora, fauna, sentient races, and minor (i.e. NPC) characters described by the input; as well as all of the well-known/described characters including their knowledge, memories, and personalities - WRT the specific point in the lore progression where the world is initialized. The world can be initialized at any point within the lore timeline such that all things and beings within are consistent thereto, will progress in a manner that best converges with the lore progression while tolerating human interaction (especially thereagainst), and can continue in a 'contextually stable / consistent manner' past the end of pre-existing lore.*

### Multi-Level, Multi-Content PCG

In 2019 during preliminary research for a since suspended CS Master's Thesis project: I discovered a parallel if not analogous description of 'The Naughtiest Problem' as described within the introduction chapter of "Procedural Content Generation In Games" written by Shaker/Togelius/Nelson (which I understand to be the first textbook on on PCG for games/simulations). In the section discussing visions of and possibilites for the future of PCG, they introduce a content generator (system) called **'Multi-Level, Multi-Content PCG'** which is described therein as follows:

> *"Multi-level, multi-content PCG refers to a content generator that, for a given game engine and set of game rules, would be able to generate all of the content for the game such that the content is of high quality and fits together perfectly. For example, given the engine and ruleset for the popular computer role-playing game (Elder Scrolls V) Skyrim, this imaginary software would generate backstory, quests, characters, items, weapons, vegetation, terrain, graphics, etc. in such a fashion that it all becomes a coherent, believable new world and an enjoyable game to play." **(PCGIG, pp. 5-6)***
