# The Naughtiest Problem and Trifold Principle of PCG

## The Naughtiest Problem

### Introduction and History

**'The Naughtiest Problem'** is a toy problem I developed which encompassed the realization of extremely advanced and detailed 3D simulation worlds that are mostly if not fully procedurally generated by computers *(i.e. s.t. human involvement is at most minor and high-level)*. More specifically: it invites discussion regarding:
* The features, requirements, and constraints of such worlds and the creation thereof; 
* The definition of how much human-provded context, content, and otherwise design/direction is needed for their creation (as well as the theoretical mimimum/optimum levels thereof); and
* How worlds that derive from and/or relate with a pre-written lore can be correctly initialized thereto WRT some specified point-in-time, consistently follow *(if not mirror)* its remaining progression *(and by what min error)*, and most interestingly: 'naturally' extend and expand itself past all pre-existing (human authored) lore

I have been thinking about this problem for many years, and it was one of the primary reasons why I returned to college to study Computer Science. However, I'm not necessarily alone in this pursuit, nor are the other people who have an interest in Procedural Content Generation (hereafter **PCG**). Almost everyone of even the slightest creative mind has likely many times envisioned stepping into a fictional world, interacting with it *(including directing its progression - both implicitly and explicitly)*, exploring an infinite numnber of alternate progressions/histories thereof, merging it with other universes *(including our own)*, and/or expanding it beyond the events described bt its authors/creators. Indeed there are entire genres of this popular throughout the internet; including *'Alternate Histories'*, *'Fan Fiction'*, and even highly collaborative and interconnected universes such as that of *'The SCP Foundation'*, *'The Backrooms'*, *'Creepypastas'*, and more.

However, it was around 2017 when I started explore beyond the 'surface level' and commence a more serious contemplation to this problem and how to build a model thereto (which was also when it received its official and silly-yet-fitting name). To the latter, and as introduction to the problem itself: I was taking a graduate course in Computer Graphics at the time, for which the instructor was retired USAF LtCol Dr. Elton P Amburn. Having previously discussed both my interests in PCG and our mutual interests/experience with immersive Virtual Reality: I visited one of his office hours where, following a short greeting, I told him that I had a very naughty problem to discussâ€¦
